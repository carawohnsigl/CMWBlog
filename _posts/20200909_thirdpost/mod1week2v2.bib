	abstract = {We used skilled typing as a task to investigate underlying cognitive processes involved in skilled action sequencing. In general, the major finding was that variation in typing performance at the letter level (how fast or you slow a typist types particular letters) can be well-explained by the statistics of letter occurrences as they appear in natural text. Our findings have implications for cognitive theory, and may also be useful for guiding typing curriculum for training typing skill.},

	abstract = {Psychologists have made substantial progress at developing empirically validated formal expressions of how people perceive, learn, remember, think, and know. In this article, we present an academic search engine for cognitive psychology that leverages computational expressions of human cognition (vector-space models of semantics) to represent and find articles in the psychological record. The method shows how psychological theory can be used to inform and aid the design of psychologically intuitive computer interfaces.},
