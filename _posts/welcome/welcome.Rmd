title: "What do I understand cognition to be?"
description: |
  I understand cognitive psychology to be the study of internal mental processes, such as perception, memory, thinking, or learning. I think that cognition is about understanding what happens between the point at which the body/brain receives external stimuli and when it outputs a response. When I picture it, I imagine cognition to be a sort of filter that sends incoming stimuli to a tree diagram of possible behavioral outcomes. Everyone’s “filter” (or cognitive process) is slightly altered based on their own personal experiences, so that the same stimuli can lead to a variety of different responses in different people.<br><br>
  As a 3D designer who has worked in exhibition design, one of the simplest examples I can think of is what people decide to do when they approach a wall, say, in an art exhibition, and have the option to turn left or right. The wall serves as the visual stimuli, and each person’s unique set of prior experiences can influence how they will respond. Perhaps they like the subject matter of the paintings to the left because it reminds them of where they grew up. Or maybe their father was a sculptor and they would prefer to see the sculptures on the right. Once they choose which gallery they’d like to see first, infinite cognitions follow. For example, they might see an abstract work of art that is perceived as different things to different people, and make their own judgement about what they think it is. The act of learning about the artist by reading the descriptions of the works is another possible cognitive process. They might even come up with some ideas for their own artwork while viewing the works on display. Visitors in the space could do all of these things, or none of them, based on the internal mental processes that occur by taking in the information available in the gallery space. <br><br>
  What I find to be most difficult about describing cognition is that it is both obvious and concrete while being impossibly abstract. I think this is because it seems to me that cognitive processes can vary based on an individual’s experiences, but they can also be quite similar to each other. Overall, I am eager to gain a deeper understanding of cognitive psychology and be able to utilize it in my work.
